Falling Banana / Banana Drop
==============

This is an experiment in building a game in HTML5 and JavaScript. I completed this project back July of 2012 and haven't done much besides reorganize the repository since.

I've very happy with how it turned out. The whole project is almost entirely in vanilla JS with only two included libraries, jQuery and hammer.js for handling touch interaction. The animation is also completely hand coded with the Canvas API, and I still really like how the giant walker creatures look. I also build an entity-component-system for the game that was helpful to learn conceptually before I started working with the Unity3d game engine a couple years later.

## Setting
In the forest you must collect food for your tribe to survive. Catch the bananas that fall from the trees above, and avoid the deadly poisionous apples. Be careful, there are also other creatures in the forest that will get in your path.
