Falling Banana
==============

This is an experiment in building a game in HTML5 and JavaScript. I completed this project back July of 2012 and haven't done much besides reorganize the repository since.

##Setting
In the forest you must collect food for your tribe to survive. Catch the bananas that fall from the trees above, and avoid the deadly poisionous apples. Be careful, there are also other creatures in the forest that will get in your path.

##Controls
On desktop:
	* Arrow keys - Move left and right
	* p - Pause
	* s - Toggle sound

On mobile/touch device:
	* Holding or tapping the game screen edge will move your character left or right.
